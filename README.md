# Farmily-Docs

Welcome to Farmily, a blockchain-based food traceability platform revolutionizing the supply chain!  This repository contains documentation, code snippets, and a demo of the Farmily project. While the full codebase remains private, you can explore how Farmily works, understand its features, and see its impact on food transparency and trust.
Overview
Farmily leverages blockchain technology to track food products from farm to table, ensuring transparency, security, and trust across the supply chain. Built on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, Farmily enables farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers to trace the journey of food items in real time, addressing key challenges like traceability delays and lack of consumer-facing transparency.
This repository serves as a documentation hub for:
Understanding Farmily’s architecture and workflow.

Exploring sample code snippets (e.g., smart contract interactions, QR code integration).

Accessing a demo to see Farmily in action.

Features
Farmily offers a robust set of features to enhance food supply chain management:
Blockchain Traceability: Uses smart contracts on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet to securely record and trace product journeys, ensuring tamper-proof data.

Real-Time Authentication: Reduces product authentication time from days to seconds, as demonstrated by our testing (e.g., 18 product registrations processed in under 2 minutes with zero errors).

QR Code Verification: Enables consumers to verify product origins with a 98.3% success rate across mobile devices, enhancing transparency.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed for non-technical users (farmers, distributors, retailers, and consumers) to interact with blockchain technology effortlessly.

Secure Data Storage: Combines on-chain and off-chain storage for cost efficiency while maintaining data integrity.

(More details and case studies coming soon!)

Getting Started
Since the full codebase is private, this repository provides a window into Farmily’s functionality. Follow these steps to get started:
Explore the Documentation:
Start with docs/architecture.md to understand Farmily’s system design.

Check docs/user-guide.md for instructions tailored to different user roles (farmers, distributors, retailers, consumers).

Review Code Snippets:
Navigate to the snippets/ folder to see examples of smart contract interactions and QR code generation.

Example: register-product.js shows how a product (e.g., Carrots from Neymar’s Farms) is registered on the blockchain.

Watch the Demo:
Head to demo/demo-video.mp4 to see Farmily in action, including QR code scanning and product tracing.

Refer to demo/demo-guide.md for instructions on exploring the demo.

Demo Highlights
The demo showcases Farmily’s core functionality:
Product Registration: Registering a batch of tomatoes on the blockchain in under 10 seconds.

Traceability: Querying the history of a product (e.g., Eggs, batch EGG-2024-001) from Neymar’s Farms to Good Farms to the consumer.

QR Verification: Scanning a QR code on a mobile device to verify product authenticity, with a 98.3% success rate across devices.

Watch the demo-video.mp4 to see these features in action!
Technology Stack
Farmily is built using a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, security, and usability:
Blockchain: Ethereum Sepolia testnet for smart contracts and data integrity.

Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity, deployed and tested using Hardhat.

Frontend: React.js for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Backend: Node.js and Express for API management.

Storage: Hybrid approach with on-chain (blockchain) and off-chain (IPFS) storage.

QR Code Integration: QR code generation and scanning using JavaScript libraries (e.g., qrcode).

Sample Code Snippet
Here’s a quick example of how Farmily registers a product on the blockchain (from snippets/register-product.js):
javascript

const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Connect to Sepolia testnet
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR-API-KEY");
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet("YOUR-PRIVATE-KEY", provider);

// Load smart contract
const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";
const contractABI = [/* ABI array */];
const farmilyContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, wallet);

// Register a product
async function registerProduct(productId, batchNumber, origin) {
  const tx = await farmilyContract.registerProduct(productId, batchNumber, origin, {
    gasLimit: 300000,
  });
  await tx.wait();
  console.log(`Product ${batchNumber} registered successfully! Transaction: ${tx.hash}`);
}

registerProduct("66f9af768996b012253fedbb", "CARROTS-001-2024", "Neymar’s Farms");

Testing Results
Farmily has been rigorously tested to ensure reliability and performance:
Smart Contract Testing: Processed 18 product registrations (e.g., Carrots, Eggs, Tomatoes) in under 2 minutes with zero errors on the Sepolia testnet.

QR Code Verification: Achieved a 98.3% success rate across various mobile devices (e.g., iOS, Android) during user testing.

User Interface: Validated through user feedback, confirming accessibility for non-technical users like farmers and consumers.

Detailed test results are available in docs/smart-contracts.md and docs/qr-verification.md.
